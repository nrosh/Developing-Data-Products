# In this project, I use the airquality data. 
# Then I show the wind speed on different days of September 1973.
# The user can select a range of wind speeds and see in which days 
# the wind speed has been in that range.
# There is also a checkbox that allows the user to choose whether or not 
# they want to view wind speed in all days (or only days with wind speed 
# in the selected range).
